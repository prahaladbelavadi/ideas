# Proposal: A decentralized solution to authenticate documents, people and identity.

## Abstract: 

- #### is it necessary :
For long, giant tech companies have undertaken the task of securing and validating our two factor authentications. [Google](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/) and [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204915) being one of the many centralized ones out there. 
Banks, Exchanges and many instutions require the use of 2 Factor Authentication to identify their customers. 2 factor Authentication plays an important role in not only securing the identity of a person but also prevent uncalculated, unintended actions by malicius entities. It is by all means a grave necessity in our digital lives.

We encounter many instances where independent entities implement 2 Factor authentication to independently establish and secure their customer's user journey where ~~~__Needs to be completed!__~~

- #### Why :

As Muneeb Ali rightly said, no single entity should have as much power such that the world relies simply on that single entity not choosing to be evil. 2 Factor authentication is extremely important to the vast majority of our population and it being administered by a single entity leads to a single point of failure despite their best attempts to thwart it.

- #### Solution :
