There are already tools that exist to do this.
This is purely a developer driven idea.

There's so many cool ui themes with angular and react and electron and all these different frameworks.
The closest thing to a good user experience for someone that's non technical but has to sift through data is Studio 3t or robo 3t apart from mongo compass.

The idea is to build a web portal, where you can plugin your credentials and directly view or query your data instead of installing a native tool.

There barely is anything to analyse data through the web.

Often startup level folks are either using native applications for minimal data cleaning purposes or just gathering bare analytics.

There are a ton of beautiful front end libraries.
There can be a server in the middle talking between a end client user and their cluster.

What is stopping us from providing a tool that people can use to have a seamless web experience to view, clean and analyse basic data via web ?

Frankly nothing.

This is a low hanging fruit for a problem to solve with utility.

This can be bootstrapped into a business by providing analytics, advanced functionality, better user experience or by running on a freemium or a saas model. Or this could also take up advertizing albeit that would be counter intuitive since we'd be parsing their data and incentives aren't necessarily aligned in a ad model.

We're better off working directly with the end customer
