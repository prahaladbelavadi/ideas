# Simple git

Git is a beautiful tool. It can get overwhelming for people that aren't accustomed to terminologies or rather are looking to use it for just one feature, versioning.

They don't care about forks, merges, collaboration. They want to version their files; In some cases, just file. 

## The proposal:
Abstract all the features away. Allow them to signup and just have a drag and drop area with an option to name it.
They can view/download versions of the file they've been working on and add new successive versions but that's about it. 

No frills no nothing. Just plain old versioning and it can use git on the backend or github/gitlab apis even. Store it on their own accounts even without maintaining state. This can be built using serverless approach
