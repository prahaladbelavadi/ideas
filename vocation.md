# Problem:

People rail against the education for they do not teach necessary skills such as filing taxes or understanding how to navigate legal procedures, obligations and what would otherwise be miscontrued to be commone sense or amidst commmon knowledge.
At schools, this likely happens because of division of labour. Schools exist for teaching Tax laws, but those that attend are on course to become Charted accountants or tax attorneys or of similar trade. People that wish to spend a lifetime doing taxes or becoming skilled at the process of navigating the legal tax system go to college for necessary vocation. Normal people, as in people belonging to different tradelines that aren't willing to invest time, effort and money to go to college to understand how to perform this action often pay someone else that did go to college to file taxes. This isn't just the case for taxes, everything from fixing your bike, car or laptop is outsourced to a specialist that knows this better than you.

If people can be taught basic electrical engineering concepts and programmming concepts that allow themm to build apps and websites, why not vocations that could likely come handy in everyone's daily life.

People file taxes each year. People need to know how to perform CPR without having to go to a specialized medical school. As such, people need to  know how to repair a flat tyre without having to call AAA all the time.
Things that make life marginally better ought to be conveyed and instilled within our people.

There exists an opportunity for people to educate masses. The masses observes chaos but those that can rally sufficient demand for instruction of comprehedable manner to understand what goes on into what would be at the verge of revolutionizing a generation that's  social media driven and where daily cooking for oneself is becoming a professional skill that has to be outsourced.

Common sense isn't common after all.

People must have options that allows them to access array of information that gives them an edge in survival situations.

Specializations can demand a premium, but lowering the barrier to knowledge consumption must be goal of a progress driven society.

Those, that posses the will, musthave options to consume.
