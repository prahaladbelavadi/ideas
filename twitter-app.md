An app to only post on twitter.

We're stuck in an information overload.

Instead of having to open twwitter, go through the feed and forget what you wanted to tweet, use this app to blatantly tweet only. Nothing more Nothing less.

Use one app to post to twitter. Why read stuff unless you're specifically looking to read ?
