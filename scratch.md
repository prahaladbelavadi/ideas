## Scratch:

- Blockchain based identities between countries
- weight of wallet in network to incentivise spending importance level
- Nonce(non repeating value) type issual of session key to have tokenless transactions recorded 
- Establishment of importance of metadata based on queries by smart contracts
- Networking on the blockchain edge values; hash store message with digital signature for ownership
- One way recursively hashed function stored on the blockchain
- Master slave node p2p implementation for processing transactions offline
- Master slave implementation similar to mapreduce for taking verifiable analytics from ground up
- Hierarchial authentication and verified by master slave node
- collecting tolls, fines and community improvement fees using the blockchain
- Hedging integrity checks and releasing funds based on verifiability (School grant,VSK chain)[Multiple token, single blockchain]
- writing integrity checks in meta data of transactions and maintaining a separate database to organize and derive analytics from.
