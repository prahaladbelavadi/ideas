dependent transaction model works on triggers

These triggers can exist in the same or other coexisting blockchains.
if in case of an altcoin, by means of atomic swaps, we can verify the nature of the trigger.

```
If the trigger is initiated{
  do this
}else{
  do nothing or do something else
}
```

These triggers are expressed as dependencies of lock time scripts. Lock time scripts are scripts that are defined by the block height.

By a certain block height, if certain criteria of locally available information(to the node from previous history) checks out, initiate protocol or if not take counter measures.

This can be helpful in setting up countermeasures against different powerful entities in consortium blockchains.


Example:
if in a consortium blockchain of countries, country XYZ decides to launch a missile that requires activation key from the blockchain or in simpler terms, requires XYZ to spend a transaction. Country PQR has counter measures set up such that, the transaction checks itself and its history every certain period of time, say 5 minutes. Once PQR realizes that the transaction has been spent, they can take counter measures to prevent losses.

If PQR initiates attack early on,XYZ keeps checking the chain for spends from PQR, on receiving the transaction that issues the attack, the counterparty can accordignly take countermeasures.


In this scenario, for each activation code to be discharged, every member is required to sign the transaction acknowledging it.

If acknowledgements aren't received, the host country isn't serious of their own security.
It is in each country's best interests to monitor the blockchain.
If a single country decides to attack, it still requires majority acceptance of people involved in the consortium blockchain. By signing contracts of countermeasures on goodwill, each country insures itself against a potential attack. This contracts check for spends or trigger points at regular intervals. On trigger being issued, the countermeasures smart contracts run.

Since every other country has signed treaties of alliance with most if not all countries for compliance of peace, initiation of a single country's attack is request for countermeasures from remaining members involved in the consortium.

essentially everyone makes alliance with others and have smart contracts to counter the inadvertent occasion of a rogue attack.

This delves insight into the byzantine fault tolerance problem with blockchains.

Unlike other systems, this one instantiates a goodwill based insurance system for powerful entities using time sensitive and trigger based approaches to byzantine fault tolerance models
