# Tinder is an app that helps people meet eachother to date.
Tinder solves a problem in a model where there's matchmaking required in a collosal data set.

Similar to the dating market, finding angels for startups and startups for angels is a critcal bar to cross.

In dating, there are a certain criteria that men and women sort for.
Some are: 
- Must be physically active
- Into adventurous or into traveling 
- Must be pretty, hot or well built.
- Must be humble, into books or something that individually preferrential to each person.

The whole tinder model in the dating world operates on the premise that people date based on looks and additional information is available should they choose to know more aboyt the person.

Similarly, in the fundraising world,
Startups are looking for angels and angels are looking for startups.
There are a certain criteria that angels look for prior to funding and there are a certain criteria that founders look for from angels prior to rasing funds from.

This criteria matching exists on both ends.
The problem exists in the lack of connectivity despite all factors such as angellist, product hunt, pioneer and weekend fund, micro angels and sub micro funds.

The problem is that startups and angels aren't able to find each other quickly and get down to business.
tinder in dating world, what's a hookup is a fund raised in the startup world

The proposal to bring down the moat is an app, similar to tinder that can match angels and startups.

The premium version if there exists one will be one that'll allow filters and criteria based sorting.

Amongst the people registered on the platform, sort out people that would fit into the criteria they defined bringing about value in time and quality of startups/ angels they get to see.

Also, if they both swipe right, they get each other's contact to talk to and can proceed with their talks.

If one swipes left but the other party still wants to contact them, the original person can place a price for a set time during which a call can be scheduled after which they can decide if they want to proceed further or not.

This implies that everyone has some value they can offer and even if it isn't visible first off, if people choose to make the leap and later see value, the sale of the service or whatever value they can provide will be much more valuable than the initial cost incurred by setting up the meeting initially.

Elevator pitch is basically tinder for startups and angels.

People talk of raising VC funds being similar to getting married but how about the whole concept of hook ups ?

There exist micro and mini angels that are more than willing to help startups even if they aren't investing right away and startups that benefit more from the value addition from the angels rather than the value brought about by the funds.

To those angels to whom investing a $1000 in 100 startups is feasible and is their preferred strategy of operating, they can and may choose to do so while the startup has to give up very little or a minute porion of equity.

More than telling that this is what the world desperately needs, let's ask why not ?

Also, similar to kickstarter where people contribute or place a stake in something they like, this tinder for business can actually be a way of raising funds from community where people can choose to donate to an Idea that they like, enjoy or resonate with.
